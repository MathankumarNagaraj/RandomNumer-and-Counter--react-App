# RandomNumer-and-Counter--react-App

ðŸš€ Project Completed: RandomNumber & Counter React App ðŸš€

I'm excited to share that I have completed a new React project: RandomNumber and Counter Increment and Decrement App! ðŸŽ‰

This app consists of two main features:

Random Number Generator: Generates a random number on the click of a button.
Counter: Allows users to increment and decrement a counter with intuitive controls.
Technologies used:

React
JavaScript
CSS
ðŸ”¹ What I learned:

Deepened my understanding of React state management using hooks.
Enhanced my skills with event handling, and DOM manipulation.
Focused on clean and modular component design.
Check out the project and feel free to share feedback or suggestions for improvement!
